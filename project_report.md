# Project Report: Rule-Based Expert System for Medical Diagnosis

## 1. Introduction

This project implements a Rule-Based Expert System for Medical Diagnosis using Forward and Backward Chaining algorithms. The system demonstrates classical AI reasoning techniques without machine learning, focusing on symbolic reasoning and knowledge representation as described in Russell & Norvig's "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach."

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Core Components

**Knowledge Base (`knowledge_base.py`)**
- Contains 15 IF-THEN rules for medical diagnosis
- Stores symptoms, diagnoses, and treatment recommendations
- Includes confidence levels and explanations for each rule
- Provides methods for rule retrieval and knowledge base queries

**Inference Engine (`inference_engine.py`)**
- Implements Forward Chaining (data-driven reasoning)
- Implements Backward Chaining (goal-driven reasoning)
- Manages Working Memory for facts and reasoning chains
- Tracks rule applications and intermediate results

**User Interface (`user_interface.py`)**
- Command-line interface for symptom input
- Menu-driven system for different reasoning modes
- Interactive diagnosis and explanation viewing
- User-friendly symptom selection and result display

**Explanation Module (`inference_engine.py`)**
- Provides reasoning transparency
- Explains step-by-step inference process
- Shows rule applications and confidence levels
- Supports both forward and backward chaining explanations

### 2.2 Data Structures

**Rule Representation:**
```python
class Rule:
    rule_id: str          # Unique identifier
    conditions: List[str] # Antecedents (symptoms)
    conclusions: List[str] # Consequents (diagnoses)
    confidence: float     # Confidence level (0.0-1.0)
    explanation: str      # Human-readable explanation
```

**Working Memory:**
- Stores current facts (symptoms and inferred diagnoses)
- Maintains reasoning chain for explanation
- Tracks used rules to prevent infinite loops

## 3. Algorithms Implementation

### 3.1 Forward Chaining (Data-Driven)

**Algorithm Overview:**
1. Initialize working memory with input symptoms
2. Iteratively apply rules whose conditions are satisfied
3. Add new conclusions to working memory
4. Continue until no new facts can be derived
5. Return all derived diagnoses

**Key Features:**
- Exhaustive inference: derives all possible conclusions
- Monotonic reasoning: facts are never retracted
- Conflict resolution: rules applied in order of definition
- Termination guaranteed: finite rule set prevents infinite loops

**Time Complexity:** O(n²) where n is the number of rules
**Space Complexity:** O(k) where k is the number of facts

### 3.2 Backward Chaining (Goal-Driven)

**Algorithm Overview:**
1. Start with a goal (target diagnosis)
2. Find rules that can conclude the goal
3. Recursively try to prove all conditions of each rule
4. If all conditions proven, goal is proven
5. Return proof result with confidence and reasoning chain

**Key Features:**
- Goal-oriented: focuses on specific diagnosis
- Depth-first search: explores one proof path at a time
- Cycle detection: prevents infinite recursion
- Confidence propagation: minimum confidence of proof chain

**Time Complexity:** O(b^d) where b is branching factor, d is depth
**Space Complexity:** O(d) for recursion stack

## 4. Knowledge Base Design

### 4.1 Medical Rules

The knowledge base contains 15 carefully designed rules covering:

**Diagnostic Rules (R001-R010):**
- Common Cold, Influenza, Strep Throat
- Migraine, Allergic Reaction, Gastroenteritis
- Bronchitis, Hypertension, Anemia, Sinusitis

**Treatment Rules (R011-R015):**
- Rest and fluids for common cold
- Medical attention for serious conditions
- Specific medications and recommendations

### 4.2 Rule Design Principles

**Completeness:** Rules cover common medical scenarios
**Consistency:** No contradictory rules
**Confidence Levels:** Reflect diagnostic certainty
**Explanations:** Provide medical reasoning for each rule

## 5. Results and Testing

### 5.1 Forward Chaining Examples

**Test Case 1: Common Cold**
- Input: runny_nose, sneezing, sore_throat
- Output: common_cold, rest, drink_fluids
- Reasoning: R001 → R011 (confidence: 0.85 → 0.90)

**Test Case 2: Influenza**
- Input: fever, body_aches, fatigue, headache
- Output: influenza, see_doctor, antiviral_medication
- Reasoning: R002 → R012 (confidence: 0.80 → 0.85)

### 5.2 Backward Chaining Examples

**Test Case 1: Migraine Proof**
- Goal: migraine
- Input: severe_headache, nausea, light_sensitivity
- Result: PROVEN (confidence: 0.70)
- Proof Chain: severe_headache, nausea, light_sensitivity → migraine

**Test Case 2: Unsuccessful Proof**
- Goal: strep_throat
- Input: runny_nose, sneezing
- Result: NOT PROVEN
- Reason: Missing required symptoms (fever, swollen_lymph_nodes)

### 5.3 System Performance

**Inference Speed:** Sub-second for all test cases
**Memory Usage:** Minimal (working memory < 100 facts)
**Explanation Quality:** Clear, step-by-step reasoning
**User Experience:** Intuitive CLI with comprehensive help

## 6. Classical AI Reasoning Demonstration

### 6.1 Knowledge Representation
- **Symbolic Logic:** Rules expressed as logical implications
- **Semantic Networks:** Symptoms connected to diagnoses
- **Production Rules:** IF-THEN format for easy interpretation

### 6.2 Inference Mechanisms
- **Modus Ponens:** Forward chaining applies logical inference
- **Resolution:** Backward chaining uses goal resolution
- **Monotonic Logic:** Facts never retracted during inference

### 6.3 Search Strategies
- **Breadth-First:** Forward chaining explores all possibilities
- **Depth-First:** Backward chaining explores proof paths
- **Heuristic-Free:** Pure logical reasoning without learning

## 7. Limitations and Future Work

### 7.1 Current Limitations
- **Limited Knowledge:** Only 15 rules, basic medical conditions
- **No Uncertainty:** Simple confidence without probability theory
- **Static Knowledge:** Cannot learn or update rules
- **No Temporal Reasoning:** Cannot handle time-dependent symptoms

### 7.2 Potential Enhancements
- **Certainty Factors:** Implement MYCIN-style uncertainty handling
- **Fuzzy Logic:** Handle imprecise symptom descriptions
- **Temporal Logic:** Reason about symptom progression
- **Machine Learning:** Automated rule discovery from data
