## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Socket Programming Implementation
```python
def simple_server(self):
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    server_socket.bind((self.host, self.port))
    server_socket.listen(5)
    # Handle client connections...

def simple_client(self, message):
    client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    client_socket.connect((self.host, self.port))
    # Send/receive data...
```

### Network Delay Calculation
```python
# Formula: dend-to-end = N √ó (dproc + dtrans + dprop)
dtrans = L / R  # Transmission delay
dend_to_end = N * (dproc + dtrans + dprop)
```
