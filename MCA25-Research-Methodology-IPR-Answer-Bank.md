# MCA25: Research Methodology and IPR — Answer Bank (Sept/Oct 2024)

Use these concise, exam‑ready points. Pick one full question per unit.

## UNIT I

### 1a) Research Methods vs Research Methodology
- Methods: Concrete techniques/tools for data collection and analysis (surveys, interviews, experiments, t‑tests); focus on “how”.
- Methodology: Logic, rationale, and philosophy guiding method choice; overall strategy; focus on “why”.
- Scope: Methods = narrower; Methodology = broader plan.
- Output: Methods → data; Methodology → justified, coherent plan.
- Flexibility: Methods can be swapped; methodology ensures validity and coherence.

### 1b) Steps in the Research Process (flow)
Problem identification → Preliminary literature review → Define objectives/RQs/hypotheses → Conceptual/theoretical framework → Choose research design → Sampling design → Instrument design & operationalization → Pilot test → Data collection → Data processing/cleaning → Data analysis → Interpretation & discussion → Conclusions & implications → Limitations & future work → Report writing & dissemination → Replication/extension.

### 1c) Problems faced by researchers in India
- Funding/infrastructure gaps; bureaucratic delays; ethics approvals.
- Limited access to quality datasets; field access; respondent reluctance.
- Publication barriers: paywalls, predatory journals, slow reviews.
- Skill gaps (advanced methods, statistics, academic writing).
- Weak academia–industry linkages; IP/plagiarism awareness issues.
- Language barriers; mentorship shortages; heavy teaching loads.
- Connectivity/power issues in field sites; administrative overhead.

### 2a) Research Problem: definition & selection criteria
- Definition: A clear, researchable, significant issue addressable via systematic inquiry to contribute to knowledge/practice.
- Criteria: Clarity/specificity; feasibility (time, cost, access, skills); significance/originality; ethical acceptability; data availability; theoretical alignment; operationalizability; defined scope; potential impact/generalization; supervisor/sponsor fit.

### 2b) Types of research (with examples)
- Basic vs Applied: Learning theory vs optimizing warehouse routing.
- Descriptive vs Analytical: Market share survey vs determinants of churn.
- Exploratory vs Conclusive/causal: Expert interviews vs A/B test for UI impact.
- Qualitative vs Quantitative: Ethnography vs regression analysis.
- Experimental vs Non-experimental: RCT vs ex post facto policy study.
- Cross-sectional vs Longitudinal: One-time survey vs 5‑year cohort.
- Others: Case study, Action research, Evaluation, Correlational, Ethnographic, Grounded theory, Design science (build/evaluate an algorithm).

## UNIT II

### 3a) Steps in conducting a literature review
- Define scope/RQs; set inclusion/exclusion criteria.
- Search strategy: keywords/synonyms, Boolean strings; databases (Scopus, WoS, IEEE, ACM, PubMed, Google Scholar).
- Screen titles/abstracts; get full texts; de‑duplicate.
- Appraise quality (relevance, rigor, recency).
- Extract data (themes, methods, findings, gaps).
- Synthesize (thematic/chronological/methodological); build conceptual map.
- Identify gaps & future work; manage references (Zotero/Mendeley); iterate & update.

### 3b) Research design and components
- Definition: The blueprint integrating philosophy, methods, sampling, measurement, and analysis to answer RQs validly.
- Components: Purpose/RQs/hypotheses; variables/operational definitions; unit of analysis; time horizon; sampling frame/method/size; instruments & procedures; treatments/controls; validity (internal/external/construct) & reliability plans; analysis plan (stats/qual coding); ethics; logistics/timeline/budget.

### 4a) Identifying gaps from literature/databases
- Gap types: Theoretical, methodological, empirical/contextual, population, contradictory results, practical/implementation, data/measurement.
- How: Read limitations/future work; backward/forward citations; bibliometrics/mapping; compare contexts/populations/methods; review measures/datasets; synthesize contradictions; study systematic reviews’ gap sections.

### 4b) Three basic principles of experimental design (Fisher)
- Randomization: Randomly assign units to treatments → reduce bias.
- Replication: Repeat treatments → estimate experimental error.
- Local control/blocking: Group similar units to reduce variance → increase precision.

## UNIT III

### 5a) Primary data collection methods
- Surveys/questionnaires (online/offline).
- Interviews: structured, semi‑structured, unstructured.
- Focus groups.
- Observations: participant/non‑participant; structured/unstructured.
- Experiments/field trials.
- Diaries/logs; think‑aloud protocols.
- Sensors/IoT, telemetry, eye‑tracking.
- Delphi technique (expert rounds).
- Trade‑offs: depth vs control; cost/time; biases; ecological validity.

### 5b) Sample design process steps
- Define target population & unit of analysis.
- Establish sampling frame (list/registry).
- Choose method: probability (SRS, systematic, stratified, cluster, multistage) vs non‑probability (convenience, judgment, quota, snowball).
- Determine sample size (power, effect size, variability, CI/precision, design effect).
- Specify selection procedure; recruitment/replacement rules.
- Execute sampling; monitor non‑response; apply weights/adjustments; document errors.

### 6a) Collecting secondary data
- Internal: sales, CRM, ERP, prior project data.
- External: government stats (Census, NSSO), regulators/industry bodies, international agencies (World Bank, UN), academic journals/books, syndicated datasets, open data portals, company filings, standards, APIs/social media (with ethics), archives.
- Assess quality: source, timeliness, completeness, bias, comparability, licensing.

### 6b) Sample survey vs Census survey
- Coverage: Sample = subset; Census = entire population.
- Cost/time: Sample cheaper/faster; Census costly/slow.
- Accuracy: Sample has sampling error but can be precise; Census reduces sampling error but risks non‑sampling errors.
- Feasibility: Census impractical for large/dynamic or destructive testing.
- Use: Sample for inference/monitoring; Census for baselines/apportionment/frames.

### 6c) Four forms of observation (with examples)
- Participant–Structured: Join as employee; rate interactions via checklist.
- Participant–Unstructured: Ethnographic immersion; open‑ended field notes.
- Non‑participant–Structured: Code behaviors from video with predefined scheme.
- Non‑participant–Unstructured: Watch shoppers; record spontaneous notes.
