*Following Anany Levitin's Methodology*

## UNIT - I

### Question 1

#### a) Two algorithms for computing GCD with analysis (10 marks)

**Algorithm 1: Euclidean Algorithm**
```
Algorithm EuclidGCD(m, n)
// Input: Two non-negative integers m and n (not both zero)
// Output: Greatest common divisor of m and n
while n ≠ 0 do
    r ← m mod n
    m ← n
    n ← r
return m
```

**Algorithm 2: Consecutive Integer Checking**
```
Algorithm CICGCD(m, n)
// Input: Two positive integers m and n
// Output: Greatest common divisor of m and n
t ← min(m, n)
while t > 0 do
    if m mod t = 0 and n mod t = 0
        return t
    t ← t - 1
```

**Analysis:**

**Euclidean Algorithm:**
- **Pros:** Very efficient, O(log min(m,n)) time complexity
- **Cons:** Requires understanding of modular arithmetic
- **Space:** O(1) - constant space

**Consecutive Integer Checking:**
- **Pros:** Easy to understand and implement
- **Cons:** Inefficient for large numbers, O(min(m,n)) time complexity
- **Space:** O(1) - constant space

#### b) Towers of Hanoi recursive algorithm and time analysis (10 marks)

```
Algorithm TowersOfHanoi(n, source, destination, auxiliary)
// Input: n disks, source peg, destination peg, auxiliary peg
// Output: Sequence of moves to transfer n disks
if n = 1 then
    move disk from source to destination
else
    TowersOfHanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, destination)
    move disk n from source to destination
    TowersOfHanoi(n-1, auxiliary, destination, source)
```

**Time Complexity Analysis:**
- Let T(n) = number of moves for n disks
- T(1) = 1
- T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1 for n > 1

**Solving the recurrence:**
- T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1
- T(n) = 2(2T(n-2) + 1) + 1 = 4T(n-2) + 3
- T(n) = 2^k T(n-k) + (2^k - 1)
- When k = n-1: T(n) = 2^(n-1) × 1 + (2^(n-1) - 1) = 2^n - 1

**Time Efficiency: O(2^n)** - exponential time complexity

### Question 2

#### a) Two ways of representing graphs (5 marks)

**1. Adjacency Matrix:**
- 2D array where A[i][j] = 1 if edge exists between vertex i and j
- Example for graph with vertices {A, B, C} and edges {(A,B), (B,C)}:
```
   A B C
A [0 1 0]
B [1 0 1]
C [0 1 0]
```

**2. Adjacency List:**
- Array of linked lists, each list contains neighbors of a vertex
- Example for same graph:
```
A → [B]
B → [A, C]
C → [B]
```

#### b) General plan for analyzing non-recursive algorithms (10 marks)

**Levitin's Framework for Algorithm Analysis:**

1. **Decide on parameter n indicating input size**
2. **Identify algorithm's basic operation**
3. **Check whether the number of times basic operation is executed depends only on size of input**
4. **Set up a sum expressing the number of times basic operation is executed**
5. **Use standard formulas and rules of sum manipulation to find closed form**

**Application: Checking if all elements in array are distinct**

```
Algorithm UniqueElements(A[0..n-1])
// Input: Array A of n elements
// Output: true if all elements are distinct, false otherwise
for i ← 0 to n-2 do
    for j ← i+1 to n-1 do
        if A[i] = A[j] return false
return true
```

**Analysis:**
1. **Parameter n:** Array size
2. **Basic operation:** Element comparison A[i] = A[j]
3. **Depends only on n:** Yes
4. **Sum setup:** ∑(i=0 to n-2) ∑(j=i+1 to n-1) 1
5. **Closed form:** ∑(i=0 to n-2) (n-1-i) = ∑(k=1 to n-1) k = n(n-1)/2

**Time Complexity: O(n²)**

#### c) Function growth with eightfold input increase (5 marks)

For input n → 8n:

1. **log₂n → log₂(8n) = log₂8 + log₂n = 3 + log₂n**
   - Increase: +3 (additive increase)

2. **n → 8n**
   - Increase: ×8 (multiplied by 8)

3. **n² → (8n)² = 64n²**
   - Increase: ×64 (multiplied by 64)

4. **n³ → (8n)³ = 512n³**
   - Increase: ×512 (multiplied by 512)

5. **2ⁿ → 2^(8n) = (2ⁿ)^8**
   - Increase: Raised to power 8

## UNIT - II

### Question 3

#### a) Quick Sort algorithm and trace (10 marks)

```
Algorithm QuickSort(A[l..r])
// Input: Subarray A[l..r] of array A[0..n-1]
// Output: Subarray A[l..r] sorted in non-decreasing order
if l < r then
    s ← Partition(A[l..r])
    QuickSort(A[l..s-1])
    QuickSort(A[s+1..r])

Algorithm Partition(A[l..r])
// Input: Subarray A[l..r] where l < r
// Output: Partition of A[l..r], position of pivot
p ← A[l]  // pivot
i ← l; j ← r + 1
repeat
    repeat i ← i + 1 until A[i] ≥ p or i = r
    repeat j ← j - 1 until A[j] ≤ p
    swap(A[i], A[j])
until i ≥ j
swap(A[i], A[j])  // undo last swap
swap(A[l], A[j])
return j
```

**Trace for [5,3,1,9,8,2,4,7]:**

Initial: [5,3,1,9,8,2,4,7]
Pivot = 5, after partition: [3,1,2,4,5,9,8,7] (pivot at index 4)

Left subarray [3,1,2,4]:
Pivot = 3, after partition: [1,2,3,4]

Right subarray [9,8,7]:
Pivot = 9, after partition: [7,8,9]

**Final sorted array: [1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9]**

#### b) Binary Search algorithm and complexity proof (10 marks)

```
Algorithm BinarySearch(A[0..n-1], K)
// Input: Sorted array A, search key K
// Output: Index of K in A, or -1 if not found
l ← 0; r ← n - 1
while l ≤ r do
    m ← ⌊(l + r)/2⌋
    if K = A[m] return m
    else if K < A[m] r ← m - 1
    else l ← m + 1
return -1
```

**Worst-case Analysis:**
- Each iteration reduces search space by half
- Let T(n) = maximum comparisons for array of size n
- T(n) = T(n/2) + 1, T(1) = 1
- By master theorem: T(n) = O(log n)

**Formal proof that T(n) ≤ ⌊log₂n⌋ + 1:**
- Base case: n = 1, T(1) = 1 ≤ ⌊log₂1⌋ + 1 = 1 ✓
- Inductive step: Assume true for n/2
- T(n) = T(⌊n/2⌋) + 1 ≤ ⌊log₂⌊n/2⌋⌋ + 1 + 1
- Since ⌊log₂⌊n/2⌋⌋ ≤ ⌊log₂n⌋ - 1
- T(n) ≤ ⌊log₂n⌋ - 1 + 2 = ⌊log₂n⌋ + 1 ✓

### Question 4

#### a) Data decomposition: Input and output partitioning (10 marks)

**Data Decomposition** is a problem-solving approach that divides the problem's data into smaller, more manageable parts.

**1. Partitioning of Input Data:**
Breaking input into smaller pieces and solving subproblems.

**Example: Merge Sort**
```

if n > 1 then
    copy A[0..⌊n/2⌋-1] to B[0..⌊n/2⌋-1]
    copy A[⌊n/2⌋..n-1] to C[0..⌊n/2⌋-1]
    MergeSort(B[0..⌊n/2⌋-1])
    MergeSort(C[0..⌊n/2⌋-1])
    Merge(B, C, A)
```

**2. Partitioning of Output Data:**
Constructing solution by building different parts of the answer.

**Example: Binary Tree Traversal**

- Process root
- Construct right subtree traversal
- Combine results

#### b) Brute Force String Matching (10 marks)

```
Algorithm BruteForceStringMatch(T[0..n-1], P[0..m-1])
// Input: Text T, Pattern P
// Output: Index of first occurrence of P in T, or -1
for i ← 0 to n - m do
    j ← 0
    while j < m and P[j] = T[i + j] do
        j ← j + 1
    if j = m return i
return -1
```

**Trace: Find "COMPUTER" in "MASTER OF COMPUTER APPLICATIONS"**

```
Text:    M A S T E R   O F   C O M P U T E R   A P P L I C A T I O N S
Pattern: C O M P U T E R

i=0: M≠C, no match

#### b) Decrease and Conquer + Insertion Sort (10 marks)

**Decrease and Conquer Approach:**
Solve problem by reducing it to a smaller instance of the same problem.

**Three variations:**
1. **Decrease by constant** (usually 1)
2. **Decrease by constant factor** (usually 2)
3. **Variable-size decrease**

**Insertion Sort Algorithm:**
```
Algorithm InsertionSort(A[0..n-1])
// Input: Array A of orderable elements
// Output: Array A sorted in non-decreasing order
for i ← 1 to n-1 do
    v ← A[i]
    j ← i - 1
    while j ≥ 0 and A[j] > v do
        A[j + 1] ← A[j]
        j ← j - 1
    A[j + 1] ← v

    heap ← false
    while not heap and 2*k ≤ n do
        j ← 2*k
        if j < n and H[j] < H[j+1]
            j ← j + 1

for j ← n-1 downto 0 do
    B[C[A[j]]] ← A[j]

return B
```

**Example:** Sort list with values from {62, 31, 84, 96, 19, 47}

### Question 8

#### a) Hashing and Collision Resolution (8 marks)

**Hashing:** A technique for storing and retrieving data using a hash function to map keys to array indices.

**Two mechanisms for collision resolution in closed hashing:**

**1. Linear Probing:**
- When collision occurs, check next slot sequentially
- h(k,i) = (h'(k) + i) mod m
- Advantage: Simple implementation
- Disadvantage: Primary clustering

**2. Quadratic Probing:**
- Use quadratic function for probing
- h(k,i) = (h'(k) + c₁i + c₂i²) mod m
- Advantage: Reduces primary clustering
- Disadvantage: Secondary clustering possible

#### b) Warshall's Algorithm (12 marks)

**Algorithm for Transitive Closure:**

**4-Queens Backtracking:**
```

```

#### b) Hamiltonian Circuit: Brute Force vs Backtracking (10 marks)

**Comparison:**

| Method | Time Complexity | Space | Approach |
|--------|----------------|-------|-----------|
| Brute Force | O(n!) | O(n) | Try all permutations |
| Backtracking | O(n!) worst case | O(n) | Prune invalid partial solutions |

**Backtracking advantage:** Early termination when partial solution cannot lead to complete solution.

*Note: Need specific graph to demonstrate Hamiltonian circuit finding algorithm.*
